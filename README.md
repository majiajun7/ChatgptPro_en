## 2. Why Carpooling?

- The official Pro subscription costs as high as \$200 per month, making individual subscriptions expensive. However, the advanced models offer performance that far exceeds the standard Plus (\$20) plan.
- By sharing this premium subscription through a carpooling approach, you can **save on costs while enjoying high concurrency and top-quality responses that come with a Pro-level service**.

## 4. Guidelines for Carpooling

1. **Account Safety and Management**  
   - We recommend logging in using the provided fingerprint browser and US residential broadband IP. **Avoid frequently switching to other proxies or nodes.**  
   - Do not lend your account to unrelated users to prevent triggering risk controls due to logins from multiple regions or devices.
2. **Usage Protocols**  
   - **Conversation Management**:  
     - Each member should create a dedicated group or folder in the “Project” view and can differentiate using folder colors.  
     - When you have a question regarding a specific project or topic, **first select the corresponding folder, then type your question on the right side**. This helps maintain orderly conversations and clear records.
     - This practice avoids mixing content from different users or projects, making it easier to search and manage historical data.
3. **Communication**  
   - A small carpooling group (or Telegram group) will be established. Please report any issues promptly within the group so everyone can benefit from mutual support.
4. **Risk Disclaimer**  
   - So far, there have been **no incidents**. Although we have chosen the safest fingerprint environment and US nodes, please note that if the official platform implements significant risk control changes, we will communicate and address them immediately.
   - Please use responsibly. Any misuse (such as extensively lending your account or engaging in malicious activities) may affect the experience for all members.
