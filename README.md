# ChatGPT Pro Carpooling Plan – Stable and Fully Powered

## 1. Overview

- **This carpooling service centers around the “Pro Subscription”.**  
  The official price is \$200, which includes **unlimited access** to all advanced models such as GPT-4, 4o, 4.5, o1, o3-mini, o3mini-high, o1-promode, and more.
- The subscription comes **without any throttling or usage limits**. In addition, you will get a fingerprint browser combined with a US residential broadband IP, which greatly reduces the risk of account restrictions. **So far, there have been no reported issues**, making it safe to use.
- Priced at **only 218 CNY per person per month** (significantly lower than the official \$200), this plan is ideal for users who require in-depth or high-volume access to GPT models.

## 2. Why Carpooling?

- The official Pro subscription costs as high as \$200 per month, making direct individual subscription expensive; however, the advantage of using advanced models far exceeds what the standard Plus (\$20) plan can offer.
- By sharing this premium subscription through carpooling, you can **save costs while enabling more people to enjoy high concurrency and top-quality responses that come with a Pro subscription**.

## 4. Guidelines for Carpooling

1. **Account Safety and Management**  
   - We recommend logging in using the provided fingerprint browser and US residential broadband IP. **Avoid frequently switching to other proxies or nodes.**  
   - Do not lend your account to unrelated users to prevent triggering risk controls through multiple regions/devices.
2. **Usage Protocols**  
   - **Conversation Management**:  
     - Each member should create a dedicated group in the “Project” or “Folder” view, and can use different folder colors to differentiate.  
     - When you need to ask questions related to a specific project or topic, **first click on the corresponding folder, then input your question on the right side**. This helps maintain orderly conversations and clear data.
     - This approach avoids mixing content from different users/projects and makes it easier to search and manage historical records.
3. **Communication**  
   - A small carpooling group (or Telegram group) will be set up. Please report any issues promptly within the group for mutual support.
4. **Risk Disclaimer**  
   - So far, there have been **no incidents**. Although we have chosen the safest fingerprint environment and US nodes, please note that if the official platform implements significant risk control changes, we will communicate and address them immediately.
   - Please act responsibly. Any misuse (such as lending your account extensively or engaging in malicious activities) may affect the experience for all members.

## 5. Enrollment & Process

1. **Assess Your Needs**:  
   - If you truly require higher concurrency and better response quality, and the standard Plus plan (\$20) no longer meets your needs, then welcome aboard to the Pro plan;

   - Inform the “Administrator” that you need to join the Pro carpool. Once a spot is confirmed, proceed with the payment.
3. **Payment & Activation**:  
   - The rate is 218 CNY per person per month, with support for various domestic payment methods.  
   - Upon payment, you will receive instructions on how to log in via the fingerprint browser, along with the account details or token, and be added to the carpooling group.
4. **Get Started**:  
   - Follow the guide to configure the fingerprint browser with the US residential broadband IP, and enjoy full access to all the advanced models and features of ChatGPT Pro.
