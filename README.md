# ChatGPT Pro Carpooling Plan – Fully Powered, No Throttling

## 1. Overview

- **This carpooling service is built around the “Pro Subscription”.**  
  The official price is \$200 per month, which includes **unlimited access** to all advanced models such as GPT-4, 4o, 4.5, o1, o3-mini, o3mini-high, o1-promode, and more.
- We have implemented **advanced technical measures to ensure there is no throttling or quality reduction** (“no dumb down”) in your responses. Our solution uses a fingerprint browser and a US residential broadband IP, which greatly minimizes any risk of account restrictions. **There have been zero issues reported so far.**
- Now available for **only \$30 per person per month** (a significant saving compared to the official \$200), this plan is ideal for users who demand high-volume, high-quality access to GPT models without any performance degradation.

## 2. Why Carpooling?

- The official Pro subscription is priced at \$200 per month, making it expensive for individual users. In contrast, the advanced models offer performance that far surpasses the standard Plus (\$20) plan.
- By sharing this premium subscription via carpooling, you not only **save costs but also get a fully optimized Pro experience** with high concurrency and top-quality responses—all without any throttling or “dumb down” issues.

## 4. Guidelines for Carpooling

1. **Account Safety and Management**  
   - It is recommended to log in using the provided fingerprint browser and US residential broadband IP. **Avoid frequently switching to other proxies or nodes** to maintain a stable environment.
   - Do not lend your account to unrelated users to prevent triggering risk controls from multiple regions or devices.
2. **Usage Protocols**  
   - **Conversation Management**:  
     - Each member should create a dedicated group or folder in the “Project” view, using different folder colors to distinguish them.
     - When asking questions related to a specific project or topic, **first select the corresponding folder, then input your question**. This helps keep conversations organized and records clear.
3. **Communication**  
   - A small carpooling group (or Telegram group) will be established. Please report any issues promptly within the group for mutual support.
4. **Risk Disclaimer**  
   - So far, there have been **no incidents**. Although we have implemented the most secure technical measures, if any significant risk control changes occur on the official platform, we will communicate and address them immediately.
   - Please use responsibly. Any misuse, such as extensive lending of your account or engaging in malicious activities, may affect the experience for all members.
